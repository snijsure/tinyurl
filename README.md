This application takes url and uses tinyurl API to shorten the URL. 

There are two things I am using that one might find useful.

* I am using this app to famililarize myself with Realm DB API  (realm.io)
seems like lot of folks are using this as replacement for sqlite database
replacement on Android 
* This app also demonstrate use of square retrofit2 library to do HTTP 
  request.
